module HTree exposing (fromList, tag, toList, toOutline, depth, nodeCount)

{-|

The purpose of this module is to transform hierarchical lists
into trees, where trees are as in `zwilias/elm-rosetree`.  A hierarchical
list is a thing like

```
   lst : List Item
```

endowed with a function
um'

```
   level : Item -> Int
```

and an initial tree, e.g.,

```
   singleton "*"
```

in the case of lists of strings.

The `level` function, which associates non-negative
numbers to items, defines the hierarchy. As an example,
consider the list of lines
of an outline:

```
Plants
   Without Flowers
   With Flowers
Animals
   Invertebrates
      Works
      Insects
   Vertebrates
        Warm-blooded
```

Each line in the list has a level: the number of leading spaces
divided by 3. For another example, consider the list

```
   [("Plants", 1), ("Without Flowers", 2), ... ]
```

The function HTree.fromList converts a hierarchical list into
a tree of items. See HTreeExamplem.

of type `a`, a function `level` which gives the level of an item,
